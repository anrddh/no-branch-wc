# no-branch-wc

This is made in response to (this post)[https://dlang.org/blog/2020/01/28/wc-in-d-712-characters-without-a-single-branch/].
The author there claims to have made wc without any branches, when in fact there are merely no explicit if statements.

The goal of this project is to create a wc programm without a single branching instruction in the entire binary.
